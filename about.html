                    My name is Noah, my online alias is `Ender`, I am an active learning game developer, ethical hacker in
                    learning, and a hardworking reliable worker.
                    Consisting my background: I have been making games through the Unity Engine since September 2019, junior
                    year of high school.<br><br>

                    I graduated high school with a 4.0+ GPA, participating in Honors & CCP Mathematics
                    as well as I graduated from Stark State College with a 3.9+ GPA.<br><br>

                    I have <a href="https://github.com/EndermanSUPREME">experience programming</a> in several languages such as C++, C#, Python.

                <h3 id="mHeader">Time at KSU</h3>
                <p>
                    While I've been at Kent State working on my Bachelor's Degree of Computer Science, I joined a number of groups:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://hacksu.com/">HacKSU</a></li>

                <h3 id="mHeader">My Game Development Adventure</h3>
                <p>
                    My early inspiration towards general programming started during early middle school, we would program
                    VEX Robotics toys for small projects.
                    I became hooked to the idea of writing code to these small vehicles and I was the best in my class when
                    it came to it, often helping other students debug their code.
                    During my two years at Stark State College I often assisted the other students in my classes when it
                    came to debugging code,
                    I often would let the other classmates know if they are struggling with their code
                    That they are free to contact me or come over and ask me any questions they have so I can help set them
                    in the
                    right direction and help them experience the learning curve I did, because when you can figure out
                    the
                    difficult problems and continue moving forward, I believe that is the greatest feeling that motivates
                    any person to strive forward through the fog.<br><br>

                    I first started learning how to program through <a href="https://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> I
                    started with HTML, CSS, & JS. Eventually I started trying other languages like Python and Java.
                    I didn't have much to display when first learning until I tried out the 2019 Unity Game Engine. I
                    started learning rapidly how to build small video games.
                    I would often give myself a random theme and challenge myself to build a working project in one week. I
                    enjoyed both the challenge and the learning curve as I began learning to build common game mechanics and
                    understanding parts of Unitys C# Framework.
                    I eventually created an <a class="mButton" href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/">Itch.IO</a> account
                    so I could participate in Game-Jams, between 2021 and 2023 I've completed 10 jams and published around
                    15+ games.<br><br>

                    Currently my project <a href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/chat">CHAT</a> is my magnum opus. In one
                    year <a href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/chat">CHAT</a> rose 200+ views, while the average view
                    count for my other titles is around 20.
                    I've mostly gone through my game development adventure on my own, teaching myself how to program in
                    Unity, work 3D modeling softwares like Blender, I have completed Jams with partners, I don't get to
                    often but I believe I can be a valuable asset
                    for staying on task and ensuring the workspace is manageable and clean, allowing any new partners to
                    enter and immediately feel comfortable and begin working.<br><br>

                <h3 id="mHeader">Path of Ethical Hacking</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been self-teaching myself <a class="mButton"
                        href="https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/activity/625394" target="_blank">ethical hacking</a> using
                    Kali Linux and pwning machines on <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">HackTheBox</a> since March
                    2022,
                    most of my experience revolves around Linux-based machine, but I am open to learn more about pwning
                    Windows Environments!
                    My batch of experience working with Python has came from reading and writing my own code for exploits
                    when attacking machines.
                    I do have experience writing my own small scripts in Bash Script.
