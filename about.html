                <h3 id="mHeader">Worker and Educational Background</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Noah, my online alias is `Ender`, I am an active learning game developer, ethical hacker in
                    learning, and a hardworking reliable worker.<br>
                    Consisting my background: I have been making games through the Unity Engine since September 2019, junior
                    year of high school.<br><br>

                    I graduated high school with a 4.0+ GPA, participating in Honors & CCP Mathematics<br>
                    as well as I graduated from Stark State College with a 3.9+ GPA.<br><br>

                    I have an Associates Degree for Video Game Design & Development from Stark State University.<br>
                    I am actively completing a Computer Science Bachelor's Degree at Kent State University.<br>
                    <br>

                    I have experience programming in several languages such as Java, Python, C#.<br>
                    I am a fast learner and comfortable working with groups to complete tasks before deadlines.
                </p>

                <h3 id="mHeader">My Game Development Adventure</h3>
                <p>
                    My early inspiration towards general programming started during early middle school, we would program
                    VEX Robotics toys for small projects.<br>
                    I became hooked to the idea of writing code to these small vehicles and I was the best in my class when
                    it came to it, often helping other students debug their code.<br>
                    During my two years at Stark State College I often assisted the other students in my classes when it
                    came to debugging code,<br>
                    I often would let the other classmates know if they are struggling with their code<br>
                    That they are free to contact me or come over and ask me any questions they have so I can help set them
                    in the<br>
                    right direction and help them experience the learning curve I did, because when you can figure out
                    the<br>
                    difficult problems and continue moving forward, I believe that is the greatest feeling that motivates
                    any person to strive forward through the fog.<br><br>
                    I first started learning how to program through <a href="https://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> I
                    started with HTML, CSS, & JS. Eventually I started trying other languages like Python and Java.<br>
                    I didn't have much to display when first learning until I tried out the 2019 Unity Game Engine. I
                    started learning rapidly how to build small video games.<br>
                    I would often give myself a random theme and challenge myself to build a working project in one week. I
                    enjoyed both the challenge and the learning curve as I began learning to build common game mechanics and
                    understanding parts of Unitys C# Framework.<br>
                    I eventually created an <a class="mButton" href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/">Itch.IO</a> account
                    so I could participate in Game-Jams, between 2021 and 2023 I've completed 10 jams and published around
                    15+ games.<br>
                    Currently my project <a href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/chat">CHAT</a> is my magnum opus. In one
                    year <a href="https://endermansupreme.itch.io/chat">CHAT</a> rose 200+ views, while the average view
                    count for my other titles is around 20.<br>
                    I've mostly gone through my game development adventure on my own, teaching myself how to program in
                    Unity, work 3D modeling softwares like Blender, I have completed Jams with partners, I don't get to
                    often but I believe I can be a valuable asset<br>
                    for staying on task and ensuring the workspace is manageable and clean, allowing any new partners to
                    enter and immediately feel comfortable and begin working.
                </p>

                <h3 id="mHeader">Path of Ethical Hacking</h3>
                <p>
                    I have been self-teaching myself <a class="mButton"
                        href="https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/activity/625394" target="_blank">ethical hacking</a> using
                    Kali Linux and pwning machines on <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">HackTheBox</a> since March
                    2022,<br>
                    most of my experience revolves around Linux-based machine, but I am open to learn more about pwning
                    Windows Environments!<br>
                    My batch of experience working with Python has came from reading and writing my own code for exploits
                    when attacking machines.<br>
                    I do have experience writing my own small scripts in Bash Script.
